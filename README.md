Sending one mass email to multiple companies by just adding their email IDs (in CC or BCC) gives a poor impression for several reasons:

🚫 Why It’s a Bad Practice?
1️⃣ Lack of Personalization

Recruiters can easily see that you sent the same email to multiple companies.
It makes your application look generic and lazy, reducing your chances of getting shortlisted.
2️⃣ Unprofessional & Spammy Look

Mass emails often get flagged as spam, and recruiters may not even open them.
Companies prefer candidates who take the time to research and personally apply for the role.
